# Project Title: Eye Exercise: A Monster Makeover

## Description of Project: 
This project started with an assignment from Professor John Williams in my MIT XPro Bootcamp in week 8.  We were given the files constructing an eye in the browser that appears to follow the mouse movement and asked to add a second eye.

After doing this, I extended the assignment and converted it into a game where the user gets to interact with a pair of eyes (the "monster") in several ways.  They can change the size and shape of the eyes; turn the watching function on and off; make the monster blink; add irises to the pupils and repeatedly change their color to a random color; and use the provided 6 "eye shadows" (the "makeover").

*Original Author:* John Williams  
*Additional Coding:* Kathryn Michael

## How to Run:

Download these three files and save them itogether in a directory:
- index.html
- style.css
- eyes.js

Open index.html in your browser. You should now be able to play the game in your browser.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements:

In the future, I would like to add a **mouth** that would add to the user interaction and animation.  I would also like to add a **flying insect** that moves across the screen randomly and is watched by the eyes.
